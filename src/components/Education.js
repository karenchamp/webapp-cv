				MSc Computer Science (Advanced Software Development) - TUD [ongoing]
			</h2>
			<p>
				I've just started my MSc in Computer Science (Advanced Software
				Development) at TUD and am excited to develop my knowledge and skills
				further.
			</p>
			<h2>BSc (Hons) Computing & IT (Software Development) - OU</h2>
			<p>
				I completed my BSc part-time with the Open University while working as a
				software engineer. While I already had my dream job and believe strongly
				in the advantages of being self-taught, I wanted to make sure I had a
				solid foundation. I really enjoyed my time at OU and graduated in 2022
				with a First Class Honours degree.
			</p>
			<p>
				My final thesis project was entitled "Retrofitting Accessibility in
				React Applications".
			</p>
			<h2>BA (Ord) Mathematics - TCD</h2>
			<p>
				My first run at third level education was a degree in Mathematics at
				TCD. While I really enjoy the subject and found it fascinating,
				ultimately I discovered that full time education doesn't work for me,
				and I chose to graduate early with my BA (Ord) degree so I could start
				my career as a software engineer.
