			<h2>Senior Software Engineer @ HubSpot</h2>
			<p>
				I've been at HubSpot for almost four years now, and I absolutely love
				it. I work on a Growth team that builds in-app onboarding experiences,
				and we have a lot of range to be creative. I've built countless React
				apps and libraries alongside my team, including wizards, demos, prompts,
				and guided tours that overlay on top of the HubSpot app itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also onboard &amp; mentor other engineers, work with analytics to
				assess the success of our tools, and am always growing my technical
				expertise by taking on bigger and bigger projects.
			</p>
			<h2>Frontend Web Developer @ USIT Travel</h2>
			<p>
				I worked at USIT for 1.5 years, where I was the sole frontend developer
				and assumed responsibility for the entire frontend experience. This
				covered seven user-facing brochure sites, plus interactive itineraries,
				visa application tracking apps, flight booking tools, and user portals.
			</p>
			<h2>Web Developer @ Together Digital</h2>
			<p>
				I was at Together Digital for two years and had the chance to work on a
				huge variety of projects. Together Digital is an exciting and ambitious
				digital agency and I got to deal with a massive variety of clients,
				learning how to build sites, meet client needs, and integrate with both
				PHP-based (ExpressionEngine) and headless (Storyblok) CMS solutions.
