			<h1>About this app</h1>
			<p>
				This app was built over about two hours while watching Grey's Anatomy.
			</p>
			<p>It was built using git on the command line and VSCode for coding.</p>
			<p>I had plenty of help from frameworks and libraries! It uses:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>React via the create-react-app utility</li>
				<li>React Router to handle routing</li>
				<li>styled-components for tightly coupled component styles</li>
				<li>Github Pages for hosting</li>
				<li>Fonts from Google Fonts</li>
			</ul>
		</>
